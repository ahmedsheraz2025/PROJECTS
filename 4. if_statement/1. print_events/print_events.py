 
# # Write a program that prints the first 20 even numbers. There are several correct
# # approaches, but they all use a loop of some sort. Do no write twenty print statements:



def main():
    for num in range(20):# /40
        # if num % 2 == 0:
        #     print(num)
        print(num * 2)
    
        
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
